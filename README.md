# 🌩️ Cloud Portfolio

Welcome to my **Cloud & DevOps Portfolio**!  
This repository hosts my personal portfolio website and showcases projects that demonstrate my skills in:

- 🚀 **CI/CD Pipelines & Automation** (GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps, Jenkins)  
- 🐳 **Containers & Kubernetes** (Docker, AKS, EKS, GKE)  
- ☁️ **Cloud Infrastructure & Monitoring** (Terraform, Azure, AWS, GCP, Grafana)  

The site itself is deployed using a **CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions → Netlify**, making it a DevOps project in its own right.
